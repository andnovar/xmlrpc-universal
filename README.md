XMLRPC-Universal is a library for consuming XML RPC services from a Windows UWP application.  For each web service, you should create a Proxy class that looks like this:

```cs
using Windows.Data.Xml.Rpc;

[XmlRpcUrl("http://www.cookcomputing.com/xmlrpcsamples/RPC2.ashx")]
class TestProxy : XmlRpcClientProtocol
{
    //Declare async RPC methods here
}
```


To implement the RPC methods, the declarations should look like this:

```cs
[XmlRpcMethod("examples.getStateName")]
public async Task<String> GetStateName(int stateIndex)
{
    //You must pass your parameters as an object array.
    return await InvokeAsync<String>(new object[] { number });
    
}
```

There is a sample application included.
